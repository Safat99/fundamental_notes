## Rational Numbers
Rational Numbers can be represent as: 
$\frac{p}{q}$ where p,q $\in$ $Z$ and q $\neq$ 0

So, in short: 

* Integers are rational number
* Fractions are rational number
* Decimals are rational number which,
    * are terminating
    * have Recurring Digit: 0.3333, 0.666 or $0.6\dot{6}$
    * have Repeating Period: 0.121121121121 or 0.$\overline{121}$


So, irrational numbers are the Real Number $R$ which is decimal but have no repeating pattern. In Short

$$
Irrational Number = Decimal + No recurring/repeating pattern
$$

We won't be able to write an irrational number like $\frac{p}{q}$

## Perfect Number

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the **sum of its positive proper divisor**

Proper Divisor means All divisors except itself

Example:

$$
6 == (1+2+3)
$$
$$
28 == (1+2+4+7+14)
$$
