# Sequences and Tuples

## Sequences
A sequence of objects is a list of these objects in some order.

- denoted using ()
- order is must. Like (a, b, c) $\neq$ (c, a, b). They both are different sequence unlike sets.
- repeatition can be happen inside sequence. 


## Tuple
Sequences may be finite or infinite. **Finite** sequences are often called ***tuples***. A sequence with k-elements is called k-tuple. Thus (a,b,c) is a 3-tuple. 2-tuple is also called **pair**

### Relation with Sets

If A and B are two sets, **cartesian product** or **cross product** of A and B written as $A \times B$, is the **set** of all **pairs**. And here the order will be maintained too. Thus the first element of the **pair** will be from A and the 2nd element will come from set B.

```math
A = \{1,2 \}, \; B = \{a,b\} \\[10pt]
A \times B = \{(1,a), (1,b), (2,a), (2,b)\} \; \neq B \times A
```
