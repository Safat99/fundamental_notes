## Proposition
A proposition(statement/claim) is statement that is either true or false.

| Statement | Proposition? | True or False |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 2 + 2 = 4 | Y            | T             |
| 33 is a prime number | Y | F             |
| Is Sky blue? | N | N/A |
| 1 + 2 + 3 = x | N | N/A |





## Atomic and Compound Proposition
An atomic proposition is a proposition that is conceptually indivisible (**cannot be broken down further**)

* "The sky is blue." (It is a standalone fact)
* "The dog is barking." (**Either true or false**)

On the other hand, a compound proposition is a statement that can be broken down further using **logical connectives** (AND, OR, IF-THEN, IF AND ONLY IF)

Some logical connectors:

1. Negation [not, $\neg$]
    * It is not raining
1. Conjuction [and, $\land$]
    * "The sky is blue and the grass is green."
1. Disjunction [or , $\lor$]
    * "I will go there or I will stay at home"
1. Implication [if-then, $\to$]
    * If it rains, then I will bring out my umbrella."
    * **If the first statement (P) is true, then the second statement (Q) must be true** P --> Q
1. Biconditional [if and only-if, $\leftrightarrow$]
    * "You will pass if and only if you study"
    * "A number is even if and only if it is divisible by 2."
    * **Two way rule**
    * p is true exactly when q is true (both must either be true or false together)


## Proof and Disproof
- A proof of a proposition is a convincing argument that the proposition is true.

- A disproof is an argument that a proposition is false. 


### Methods of Proof to establish the truth of a proposition

1. Direct Proof
2. Proof by Contrapositive
3. Proof by Contradiction
4. Proof by Cases
5. Proof by Induction
