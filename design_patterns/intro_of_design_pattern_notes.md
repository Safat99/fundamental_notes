in 1994 the Gang of 4 wrote a famous book of design patterns where they have briefly explained all the design 23 design patterns for OOP softwares.

### What is it?
In software Engineering, developers faces common problems and they need to solve them. Now all these common problems have the common solutions or strategies. They are called design pattern. If we use them, we will save a lot of time as they are the most efficient one for those problems.

### Why needed?
Design pattern is very much useful for designing and building softwares using OOP principles. 

If the experience coders solves a problem, they always want to reuse them so that all the rest of the codes becomes easy. The ultimate goal is to **increase the reusability of codes** so that it is easy to **scale up** the codes.

### The main two principles for writing OOP softwares 
* Always use `Composition` over `Inheritence`
* When we code, always write code for `Interface`, not for the `Implementation`.

### Main Categories
All the 23 design patterns are based on these two principles.
We have to know all of them. We have to based on the requirements which pattern is needed to use.

They are mainly 3 Categories:
    
    * Creational
    * Structural
    * Behavioural 

### Creational 
The main target is to how to create an object.
If the requirement is to create an object we will have to use Creational Design patterns.
The creational patterns are:

* Singleton
* Factory -> in spring, factory is mainly used.
* Abstract factory
* Builder
* Prototype


### Structural
The main target is to compose two objects. If we have two objects and the main target is to compose them, we will have to use structural design pattern. In this category, there are 7 patterns. They are:

1. Adapter --> used in moblie app
2. Composite
3. Proxy
4. Fly weight
5. Facade
6. Bridge
7. Decorator


### Behavioural
How tow objects communicate/interact with each other are mainly desicribed on the behavioural design pattern. There are around 12 patterns but we will learn some of the most popular patterns of them. Some of the most popular patterns are:

* Observer
* Visitor
etc.
